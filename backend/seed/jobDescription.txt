ORCHARD’S MISSION
We Are Orchard is a management agency for associations that actively contribute to the development of an environmentally-friendly circular economy.

Our mission is to ensure we can live on this planet sustainably – but in order to achieve this, we need to effect change much faster than we are now. Focusing exclusively on industries that will help meet this objective, notably anaerobic digestion, biogas and cleantech, we provide management support to organisations that drive those game-changing sectors forward.

We assist our clients in communicating their sector’s value, winning government support, accessing new markets, attracting investment and amplifying their R&D programmes. We offer strategic advice, a full range of management services (policy, membership, events, publications, and finance) and practical support to enable our partners to be as effective as possible.

Our current clients are the Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association (ADBA) and the World Biogas Association (WBA). Additionally, We are Orchard manages the annual cleantech investment event Cleantech Innovate.
